# 🐍 Python Learning Journey

Hi there 👋 I'm **Lionel**, an aspiring **AWS DevOps Engineer** currently mastering **Python** through **Codefinity** to strengthen my automation, scripting, and development skills.

This repository documents my complete journey learning Python — from the fundamentals to building real-world projects that align with my cloud and DevOps goals.

---

## 🎯 Why I’m Learning Python

As I progress through my AWS and DevOps journey, I’ve realized that Python is an essential skill for:
- Automating AWS workflows using **Boto3**
- Writing scripts for **CI/CD pipelines**
- Building small **APIs and backend utilities**
- Exploring future paths in **AI & Machine Learning**

This repo will serve as a roadmap and portfolio of my growth as I learn to code like an engineer.

---

## 🧩 Current Phase

- ✅ Completed: **Codefinity Python Basics** (syntax, loops, conditionals)
- 🎯 Current: **Functions & Modules**
- 🔜 Next: **OOP, APIs, and File Handling**
- 💡 Future: Automation scripts for AWS & DevOps tasks

---

## 🧠 Skills I’m Building

- Python fundamentals (variables, lists, loops, conditionals)
- Functions, classes, and modules
- Working with APIs & JSON
- File handling and automation
- Scripting for AWS (Lambda, Boto3)
- Git & GitHub version control
